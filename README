Partty!
-------
Terminal sharing system.


*Install

  1. Checkout and build mpio library
    $ svn co http://svn.coderepos.org/share/lang/c/mpio/trunk/mp src/mp
    $ make -C src/mp

    Note: ruby is required.


  2. Run ./configure && make && make install
    $ ./autosetup.sh
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make install

    Note: g++ >= 4.1 is required.

    Note: following files will be installed:
      $PREFIX/bin/partty-host
      $PREFIX/bin/partty-server
      $PREFIX/bin/partty-gate
      $PREFIX/bin/partty-scale
      $PREFIX/bin/captty


*Usage

  1. Run partty-server and partty-gate. They will listen on
     2750/tcp (accept partty-host) and 7777/tcp (accept telnet guest)
     by default.
     See `partty-server --help' or `partty-gate --help' for more
     details.

    $ partty-server &
    $ partty-gate &


  2. Start terminal sharing using partty-host with the host name
     where partty-gate and partty-server are running.

    $ partty-host localhost

    Note: When partty-host starts, $PARTTY_SESSION environment
          variable is set. Following ~/.bashrc setting is useful
          to tell whether the terminal is being shared or not.

          # Change prompt when sharing the terminal.
          if [ -n "$PARTTY_SESSION" ]; then
                  PS1="[\u@$PARTTY_SESSION! \W]$ "
          fi


  3. Use telnet to join the shared terminal session. The port number
     is 7777.

    $ telnet localhost 7777

    Note: Don't join the session on the partty-host that hosting the
          session.  It will casuse inifnite loop.
